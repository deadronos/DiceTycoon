# Dice Tycoon - Prototype

What I added

- index.html: Basic UI with coin counter, die display, roll button, dice list, upgrades, and prestige.
- styles.css: Minimal styling and layout.
- app.js: Core logic including Die class, roll rewards, upgrade shop, auto-rollers, prestige, and localStorage save.

How to run

1. Open `d:/GitHub/DiceTycoon/index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local web server).
2. Click "Roll" to earn coins. Purchase upgrades in the Shop. Prestige at 5,000 coins to gain Luck Points.

Notes & next steps

- This is a lightweight sketch. Improvements: animations, better scaling, offline earnings calculation, achievements, and React rewrite for larger scope.
- I used LocalStorage under the key `dicetycoon_v1` for saves.
