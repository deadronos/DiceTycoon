# Dice Tycoon UI Scaffold

This scaffold provides a small Vite + TypeScript prototype of the UI mockup and tests.

## Documentation

- [High-level game overview](docs/high-level-overview.md)

Gameplay note: combos (pairs, triples, straights, etc.) now grant a small credits bonus when they occur â€” the UI will show a combo toast and the bonus percentage. See `docs/high-level-overview.md` for details.

How to run

- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm test
