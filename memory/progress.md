
# Progress

## Summary

- Memory Bank initialization completed on 2025-10-06. Core memory files and the initial task entry were created. Regular maintenance is ongoing.

## What works

- Core memory files exist: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Tasks index and TASK001/TASK002 exist under `memory/tasks/`.
- Design documents were added under `memory/designs/` for core gameplay, persistence, autoroll, numeric safety, and related decision records.

## What's left

- Populate `memory/designs/` with additional feature designs and decision records as features are implemented.
- Add and maintain task entries in `memory/tasks/_index.md` as features are implemented; include links to related designs.
- Decide on an archival strategy for completed tasks (keep in `_index.md` vs `memory/tasks/COMPLETED`).

## Known issues

- Linting requires H1 at top of files; project guidelines suggested avoiding H1 in body contentâ€”we chose to follow the linter for file-level clarity.

## Recent activity

### 2025-10-06

- Created core memory files and tasks index as part of memory bank initialization.
- Backfilled design documents under `memory/designs/`:
  - `D001-core-gameplay.md`
  - `D002-persistence.md`
  - `D003-autoroll.md`
  - `D004-numeric-safety.md`
  - `DEC001-serialization-decision.md`

### 2025-10-30

- Reviewed Memory Bank contents and updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect current state.
- Added a new validation task `TASK003-validate-memory-bank.md` (pending) to keep the Memory Bank aligned with the repository and team processes.

### 2025-10-30 (validation)

- Executed `TASK003` validation to confirm Memory Bank and repository synchronization.

- Validation results summary:
  - Core memory files present and up-to-date: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
  - `memory/tasks/_index.md` updated: TASK003 moved to Completed.
  - `memory/designs/` contains expected design documents (D001..D004, DEC001, DECIMAL_GUIDE).
  - `src/utils/decimal.ts` and `src/utils/storage.ts` exist and provide the helpers referenced in memory docs.
  - No immediate formatting or heading issues detected during this quick validation.

- Actions taken: updated `memory/tasks/TASK003-validate-memory-bank.md` (marked Completed), updated `memory/tasks/_index.md`, and appended this progress entry.
