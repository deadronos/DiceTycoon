# Progress

## Summary

- Memory Bank initialization completed on 2025-10-06. Core memory files and the initial task entry were created.

## What works

- Core memory files exist: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Tasks index and TASK001 have been created under `memory/tasks/`.
- Design documents were added under `memory/designs/` for core gameplay, persistence, autoroll, and numeric safety.

## What's left

- Populate `memory/designs/` with additional feature designs and decision records as features are implemented.
- Add more tasks to `memory/tasks/_index.md` as features are implemented.
- Review memory files with the team and adjust formats if requested.

## Known issues

- Linting requires H1 at top of files; project guidelines suggested avoiding H1 in body contentâ€”we chose to follow the linter for file-level clarity.

## Recent activity
