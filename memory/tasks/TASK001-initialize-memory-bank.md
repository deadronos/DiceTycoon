# TASK001 - Initialize memory bank

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06

## Original Request

Follow `memory-bank.instructions.md` and create/update project memories in `/memory`.

## Thought Process

The repository contained an empty `memory/` tree with `designs/` and `tasks/` directories. To follow the project's memory-bank template I created the canonical core memory files that act as the project's single-source context (project brief, product context, active context, system patterns, tech context, progress) and added an initial task index and this task file documenting the work.

## Implementation Plan

- Create the core memory files under `memory/`.
- Populate `memory/tasks/_index.md` with an entry for this task.
- Create `memory/tasks/TASK001-initialize-memory-bank.md` documenting the original request and the actions taken.
- Add initial progress entry to `memory/progress.md`.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
