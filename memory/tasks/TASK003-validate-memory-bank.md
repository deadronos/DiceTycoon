# [TASK003] Validate Memory Bank and Synchronize with Repository

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-30  
**Updated:** 2025-10-30

## Original Request

Create a validation task that inspects the `memory/` folder for completeness, updates core memory files where appropriate, and ensures `memory/tasks/_index.md` reflects current tasks. This task is intended to be run periodically (e.g., after major merges) to keep the Memory Bank accurate.

## Thought Process

The Memory Bank has the required core files but they can drift if repo changes, renames, or new design docs are added without updating the index. A short, repeatable validation task helps maintain accuracy and is easy for contributors to run.

## Implementation Plan

- Step 1: Review `memory/` for presence of core files:
  - `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `tasks/_index.md`, `designs/`.
- Step 2: Verify `memory/tasks/_index.md` lists all outstanding tasks and that completed tasks are dated.
- Step 3: Add or update a brief entry in `progress.md` noting results of the validation.
- Step 4: If the team prefers archiving, move completed `TASK` files into `memory/tasks/COMPLETED/` (create the folder if missing).
- Step 5: Run basic linting (markdown headings, front matter expectations) and surface any formatting issues.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-30

- Validation executed by maintainer agent.

- Results:
  - Core memory files present: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md` (OK).
  - `memory/tasks/_index.md` verified: TASK001 and TASK002 listed in Completed; TASK003 originally listed in Pending â€” now moved to Completed (OK).
  - `memory/designs/` contains design documents including `D001-core-gameplay.md`, `D002-persistence.md`, `D003-autoroll.md`, `D004-numeric-safety.md`, `DEC001-serialization-decision.md`, and `DECIMAL_GUIDE.md` (OK).
  - `src/utils/decimal.ts` and `src/utils/storage.ts` present and match the helper names referenced in memory docs (OK).
  - No formatting/linting issues were detected in core memory files during this quick check (manual review).
  - Archival: No `memory/tasks/COMPLETED/` was created and no files were moved; archival is a team decision (SKIPPED).

- Actions taken:
  - Updated `memory/progress.md` with validation entry.
  - Updated `memory/activeContext.md` to note TASK003 run and results.
  - Updated `memory/tasks/_index.md` to mark TASK003 as Completed (2025-10-30).
