# TASK002 - Add design documents to Memory Bank

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06

## Original Request

Backfill designs with feature designs and decision records.

## Thought Process

To make future development and reviews easier, create design documents that capture the core gameplay, persistence, autoroll, and numeric safety decisions. Also record the key decision around serialization and Decimal handling.

## Implementation Plan

- Add design docs under `memory/designs/`:
  - `D001-core-gameplay.md`
  - `D002-persistence.md`
  - `D003-autoroll.md`
  - `D004-numeric-safety.md`
  - `DEC001-serialization-decision.md`
- Link to these designs from `memory/activeContext.md` and `memory/progress.md`.
- Create this task file documenting the action.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
