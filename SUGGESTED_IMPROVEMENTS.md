# Dice Tycoon: Suggested Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements for the Dice Tycoon game, building upon the existing mechanics and project goals.

## 1. Enhanced Prestige System: "Luck" as a Strategic Currency

The current prestige system is a great start. To make it more engaging, "Luck" could be transformed from a simple multiplier into a currency for purchasing powerful, strategic upgrades.

### Proposed Mechanics:

*   **Luck Shop:** Instead of a single prestige button, introduce a "Luck Shop" or "Prestige Tree" where players can spend their earned Luck points on a variety of permanent upgrades.
*   **Strategic Upgrade Paths:** Offer different branches of upgrades in the Luck Shop, allowing players to specialize their playstyle. For example:
    *   **Roll-focused upgrades:** Increase the chance of high rolls, boost combo multipliers, or even add a small chance for a die to "crit" for massive earnings.
    *   **Automation-focused upgrades:** Improve offline progress calculation, reduce autoroll cooldown beyond what's possible with credits, or unlock a "batch roll" feature that performs multiple rolls at once for a reduced cost.
    *   **Economy-focused upgrades:** Reduce the cost of unlocking and leveling up dice, or increase the starting multiplier for all dice.
*   **Visual Feedback:** When a player prestiges, add a more dramatic visual effect to celebrate their progress and make the reset feel more rewarding.

## 2. Unique Die Abilities: Adding Depth and Strategy

To differentiate the dice and add a layer of strategy, each die could have a unique passive ability that influences the game in a special way.

### Examples of Die Abilities:

*   **The Multiplier Die (Die #2):** Has a 10% chance on each roll to double the output of one adjacent die.
*   **The "Generous" Die (Die #3):** When it rolls a 6, it adds a small, permanent boost to its own multiplier.
*   **The "Chain Reaction" Die (Die #4):** When it's part of a combo, its earnings for that roll are tripled.
*   **The "Lucky" Die (Die #5):** Slightly increases the chance of getting a combo.
*   **The "Golden" Die (Die #6):** Doesn't generate credits directly, but instead multiplies the total earnings of all other dice by a small percentage.

These abilities would make the order in which players unlock and level up their dice more meaningful and encourage different strategies.

## 3. Expanded Statistics and Achievements

To increase player engagement and provide a better sense of accomplishment, the statistics panel could be expanded, and an achievement system could be introduced.

### Proposed Additions:

*   **Detailed Statistics Panel:**
    *   **Lifetime Stats:** Total credits earned, total rolls, total combos, total prestiges.
    *   **Per-Die Stats:** Credits earned by each die, number of times each face has been rolled.
    *   **"Best Roll" Stat:** Show the highest-earning roll a player has ever achieved.
*   **Achievement System:**
    *   **Milestone Achievements:** "Reach 1 million credits," "Unlock all 6 dice," "Prestige for the first time."
    *   **Challenge Achievements:** "Roll a six-of-a-kind," "Get 100 combos in a single session."
    *   **Hidden Achievements:** For discovering unique or rare events.
    *   **Rewards:** Achievements could award a small amount of Luck points or unique cosmetic rewards.

## 4. UI/UX Polish and Onboarding

A few small tweaks to the UI and a simple onboarding process could significantly improve the new player experience.

### Proposed Improvements:

*   **Tutorial/Onboarding:** A short, automated tutorial on the first playthrough that guides the player through their first roll, first level-up, and explains the goal of the game.
*   **"Can Upgrade" Indicators:** When a die or autoroll can be upgraded, make the button glow or add a subtle animation to draw the player's attention to it.
*   **Celebratory Effects:** For very large credit gains or rare combos, enhance the visual feedback with more dramatic particle effects or screen shakes.
*   **Clearer Tooltips:** Add more detailed tooltips to all major UI elements that explain their function in detail.

These suggestions are designed to be modular and can be implemented incrementally. They aim to increase the strategic depth, player engagement, and long-term replayability of Dice Tycoon.
